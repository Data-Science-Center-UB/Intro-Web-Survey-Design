# Good Planning, Better Survey Data: Introduction to Web Survey Design

These open educational resources (OER) provide training materials for an introductory workshop on web surey, tailored to researchers from all disciplines and career stages. The materials are intended for participants with little or no prior experience in questionnaire design.

The workshop has been delivered and evaluated twice in two 6 hours long online training sessions and follows a lecture-style format with embedded interactive exercises.

**Topics covered**:

* Importance of a well-designed questionnaire
* Characteristics of a well-designed questionnaire
* Introduction to measurement theory
* Types of questions and response scales
* Questionnaire structure and layout
* Challenges and pretesting
* Using existing instruments
* Ethics and data protection
* Documentation
* A guide on getting started

**About the project**

This workshop was developed and delivered within the framework of the **DataNord** project at the **Data Science Center of the University of Bremen**. The DataNord project is funded under the grant number 16DKZ2026A by the Federal Ministry of Research, Technology and Space (BMFTR) and financed by the European Union â€“ NextGenerationEU.

It is part of a broader initiative to strengthen data literacy among researchers by offering practical, hands-on training in core areas of 1) data science, 2) research data management (RDM), 3) critical thinking, and 4) ethical, legal and social aspects (ELSA).



Conducting web surveys is a foundational method for data collection across disciplines. This workshop strengthens researchers' data literacy by equipping them with the skills to design, implement, and evaluate online surveys in a methodologically sound way.

The workshop builds foundational data science competencies by emphasizing the relationship between data collection and subsequent data analysis. Participants learn how design choices influence the structure, completeness, and interpretability of the data. By understanding common sources of bias and response error, researchers are better equipped to make informed decisions during pre-processing and analysis.

The programme also introduces key concepts of research data management (RDM) in the context of web surveys, emphasizing the importance of documenting data collection methods. Participants are encouraged to plan for transparency and reuse from the outset by organizing their materials, documenting the field phase and preparing metadata to support FAIR data principles.

This web survey design training fosters critical thinking by encouraging participants to scrutinize methodological choices and their implications for data quality. Through the analysis of dropout, nonresponse, and bias, participants learn to assess the validity and representativeness of web survey data more rigorously.

Using real-world examples and discussing frameworks like the GDPR and Good Scientific Practice, the workshop promotes ethically responsible and legally compliant web survey design.
